As students at the University of Pennsylvania, we wanted to find a way that our work during PennApps Fall 2015 could have a positive impact on the community we live in. One problem we were aware of is the high prevalence of HIV in the city of Philadelphia. That's how we decided to create an Android app to help connect people with HIV prevention and treatment options. One portion of our app helps users find the nearest faculty that provides free condoms, which are very effective in preventing HIV. Another directs them towards the HIV treatment facilities that are closest to them. Finally, the app has a small informational section to promote awareness about the prevalence of HIV in Philadelphia, and about the virus itself. This app uses the Google Maps API to translate data provided by the Philadelphia government into an interactive and user friendly Android application. Next steps for our app include adding more of the design elements that we have planned, such as better transitions, more individualized graphics, and a more intuitive user experience.

This app was created during PennApps Fall 2015.
